# 22.0.0
## Removals

    - Classes
    - Enum abstracts
    - `public`, `static`, and `private` keywords
    - Parsing that was too strict for its own good

- Moved SScript files to `hscript` and HScript files to `hscriptBase`

**Note**: SScript's history and versioning system is a mess (honestly the entire library is), so I am hoping to fix it in this update.
Everything that made SScript bad and unusable is removed and SScript goes back to its core, being a HScript fork.
From now on, SScript will use the Semantic Versioning system properly and I will fix any bugs I find.
